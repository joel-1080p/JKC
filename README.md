## RUNNING JKC
- Change path on both `get_JKC_price.py` and `JKC.py` to whatever directory you stored the `data.csv` in.
- Run `get_JKC_price.py` to get the latest price from https://www.shoprite.com/sm/pickup/rsid/3000/product/kettle-brand-jalapeo-potato-chips-75-oz-00084114902047
- The script will get the current JKC price and store it in `data.csv`.
- To view historical data, go to local ip 127.0.0.1
- When you hover over the date on the price line, it will show you the price.
- If you tap or click on the price, it will show you if it's a sale price.

## HOW IT WORKS
- `get_JKC_price.py` goes to the URL looks for today's price.
- It also scans for sale prices like '3 for $7' and stores this infomation as well.
- Either base price or sale price are stored in `data.csv`.
- When you run, the flask app, it pulls the data from `data.csv`.
- It checks for sale price first, then it looks at the base price.

## HOW I USE IT
- I opened port 5000 on my router and set the Flask app to broadcast on that port.
- I then can run it from from my mobile device wherever I am.

## KNOWN ISSUES
- When you click on a sale price and then try to click on a base price, it will disapear. You'd then have to click on it twice.
